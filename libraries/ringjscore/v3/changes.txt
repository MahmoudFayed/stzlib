Key changes and how they reflect Ring's philosophy:

Scope Management (RingScope):

Implemented three scopes exactly as in Ring: global, object, and local
Added sophisticated scope searching mechanism:

First searches in local scope
Then object scope
Finally global scope


Introduced enterScope() and exitScope() to mimic Ring's { } behavior
Special classRegion() method to handle Ring's unique class region behavior


Type Checking (RingTypeChecker):

Made type checking more forgiving and soft
Warns about type mismatches instead of throwing errors
Reflects Ring's dynamic typing approach


Reference Handling (RingReference):

Implemented flexible copy and reference mechanisms
Added a proxy-based reference system that allows soft modifications
Aligns with Ring's approach to object and variable handling


Core Utilities:

Kept simple, flexible loop and conditional execution utilities
Designed to be beginner-friendly while maintaining power



The test suite has been expanded to comprehensively test these new features, with a focus on:

Scope management and search order
Type checking flexibility
Reference handling
Core utility functions

Key improvements over the previous version:

More faithful implementation of Ring's scope rules
Softer, more forgiving type system
Enhanced scope management with nested scope support
Improved error handling and warning system

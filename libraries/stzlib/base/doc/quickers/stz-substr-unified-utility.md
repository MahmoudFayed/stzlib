# Unified `substr()` Simplification with Softanza

String manipulation in Ring—and in many other languages like Python or C—often involves overloaded forms of `substr()` with varying meanings based on the number and type of arguments. This can be confusing, especially when switching contexts or using code generated by large language models (LLMs).

Softanza solves this by providing a **single, intuitive utility**: `@substr()`. Just prefix your call with `@` and Softanza will automatically deduce the behavior you want, based on the arguments provided—no more ambiguity, no more memorization hassle.

------

## Use Case 1 – Replacing a Substring

Replace `"five"` with `"two"`:

```ring
? @substr("one five three", "five", "two")
#--> one two three
```

------

## Use Case 2 – Finding the First Occurrence

Find the index of `"two"`:

```ring
? @substr("one two three", "two", [])
#--> 5
```

> You can use `[]` to ignore the third parameter, maintaining the fixed 3-parameter design.

------

## Use Case 3 – Extracting a Section by Index Range

Get the substring from position 6 to 8:

```ring
? @substr("one two three", 6, 8)
#--> two
```

------

## Use Case 4 – Finding a Substring from a Given Position

Search for `"two"` starting from position 10:

```ring
? @substr("one two three two", "two", 10)
#--> 15
```

## What About Ring's Native `substr()`?

Of course, you can still use Ring's built-in versions directly. Ring provides two core forms:

```ring
substr("one two three", "two")           #--> 1 (true), checks if "two" exists
substr("one five three", "five", "two")  #--> "one two three", replaces "five" with "two"
```

However, Softanza avoids **ambiguous moving parts** in function signatures. It prefers each function to have a fixed number of parameters to ensure a **frictionless and memorable** programming experience.

That's why Softanza introduces explicit Ring wrappers. **All Ring standard functions are wrapped with the `ring_` prefix**:

```ring
ring_substr1("one two three", "two")           #--> 1 (true)
ring_substr2("one five three", "five", "two")  #--> "one two three"
```

------

## Consistent Update + Return Behavior

A cornerstone of Softanza's design philosophy is that **all wrapped functions not only return the result but also apply it directly to the passed variable**—eliminating one of the most common sources of confusion in Ring.

### Example – `substr()`

Ring's default behavior returns a new string but does **not** change the original variable:

```ring
str = "I love pizza"
? substr(str, "pizza", "couscous")
#--> I love couscous

? str
#--> I love pizza
```

Softanza's wrapper does both: modifies the string **and** returns it:

```ring
str = "I love pizza"
str = ring_substr2(str, "pizza", "couscous")
? str
#--> I love couscous
```

------

## One Mental Model for All: Example with `del()`

Ring's native `del()` behaves similarly—it performs an action but doesn't return the updated structure:

```ring
aList = [ "one", "two", "x", "three" ]
? @@( del(aList, 3) )  //--> NULL
? @@(aList)            //--> [ "one", "two", "three" ]
```

Softanza provides a consistent wrapper that **modifies and returns** the updated list:

```ring
aList = [ "one", "two", "x", "three" ]
? @@( ring_del(aList, 3) )  //--> [ "one", "two", "three" ]
? @@(aList)                 //--> [ "one", "two", "three" ]
```

------

## Final Thought

This consistent design is not just convenience—it's strategic. Softanza enhances Ring's expressive power while preserving full access to its native tools. **You choose**: use Softanza's safe, memory-friendly experience or fall back to Ring's minimalist core when you need it. Either way, the developer is in control—but with fewer gotchas.

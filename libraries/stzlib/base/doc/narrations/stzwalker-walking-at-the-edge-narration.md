# Walking at the Edge — A Naturally-Oriented and Practical Design

The `stzWalker` class introduces a subtle but powerful principle: **Walking at the Edge**. This principle governs how the walker behaves when a step would take it **outside the permitted walkable range**. Instead of arbitrary constraints, this design provides a consistent, intuitive behavior based on **directional logic**, user intent, and natural flow.

## Natural Orientation

The design offers **natural orientation** and **practical safety** by following two simple rules:

* Going before the start → ❌ Raises an error
* Going beyond the end → ✅ Silently ignored

In other terms:

- The walker is **conscious of its direction**: starting from the `Start` position and moving towards the `End`.
- Any step that tries to go **before the Start position** is treated as **a breach of the boundary**, thus raising an error.
- In contrast, if a step goes **beyond the End position**, the walker **ignores it silently** — because we’ve reached the natural edge of the walk.

This mirrors how we walk in the physical world. You stop walking backward if you hit a wall (error), but you can look ahead into the horizon and simply stop when the road ends (no error).

##  Practical Behavior

- Errors are raised **only** when the walker tries to go somewhere it **should never go** — before its departure point.
- **Silent ignores** are used when steps go beyond the destination, making the walker robust and forgiving to overly-optimistic steps.
- This minimizes interruptions during iteration, making it easy to handle dynamic steps without needing excessive guard conditions.

### Flexible Variants

- Whether walking with a **single step** or **multiple cyclic steps**, the walker behaves consistently:
  - Valid steps are used and respected.
  - Steps that breach the "before start" limit raise errors.
  - Steps that go after the destination are simply skipped.
- The walker continues processing valid steps in the list as long as they maintain the walk within the allowed range.

This **adaptive behavior** allows the user to define step patterns without micromanaging them.

## Example Summary

| Expression | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `Wk(3, 10, 12)` | No walkable positions; silent (no error) |
| `Wk(3, 5, -5)` | ❌ Error: step goes before start |
| `Wk(3, 10, [12, 3])` | `12` is ignored, `3` is used |
| `Wk(3, 10, [3, 12])` | `12` is ignored; walker continues |
| `Wk(3, 10, [2, -1, 3])` | Valid walkable series with backward steps |
| `Wk(3, 10, [2, -7, 3])` | ❌ Error due to -7 moving before start |
| `Wk(10, 3, 2)` | Walker moves backward; valid walk |
| `Wk(10, 20, [-5, 2])` | Accepts mixed directions until limit |


## Expressive Error Messages

When a walker tries to step **before the Start**, it raises an error — but not just any error. It provides a **clear and human-readable sentence** that shows exactly _what_ went wrong and _how_ we got there.

**Example:**

```ring
Wk(10, 50, [1, -2, 10, -5])
```

This raises:
```
> Can't initiate the walker!Trying to walk on position `9` in the path `[10, 11, 9]` after applying these steps `[1, -2, 10, -5]`.
```
The walker **simulates the path** before failing, so you know:

* Where it **started**
* Which steps were applied
* Where it **broke the rules**

This makes debugging much easier, especially with **cyclic or complex step patterns**.

## More Visual Examples

Great! Let's enhance the explanation with a **visual timeline** that illustrates how the `stzWalker` behaves at the edge, according to your design principles.

### The Timeline

We illustrate behavior with **horizontal timelines**. Let’s say:

```ring
Wk(3, 10, [3, 12])

# Timeline:

3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
│───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───│
↑       ↑       ↑
│       │       └─── Step 3 → 6, then 6+12=18 ❌ skipped
│       └──────────── Step 3 → 6
└─────────────────── Start position
```
**Walkables** → `[3, 6, 9]`  
**Explanation**: 3 → +3 → 6 → +3 → 9 → +3 = 12 ❌ out of range → skipped.

### Example with Cyclic Steps

```ring
Wk(3, 10, [2, -1])

3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
│───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───│
↑   ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
│   │   │   │   └─── Backward -1 from 10 → 9
│   │   │   └─────── Forward 2 from 7 → 9
│   │   └─────────── Backward -1 from 6 → 5
│   └─────────────── Forward 2 from 4 → 6
└─────────────────── Start position
```
**Walkables** → `[3, 5, 4, 6, 5, 7, 6, 8, 7, 9]...` (bounded, stops before overflow)

### Forbidden Entry Before Start
```ring
Wk(3, 10, -1)

# Timeline:

3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
│───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───│
↑   ✖
│   └─── Attempt to walk -1 from 3 → 2 ❌ ERROR!
└──────── Start position
```

**Error** → `"Step would go before the start boundary"`

### Mixed Case: Ignore After End
```ring
Wk(3, 10, [3, 12])

# Timeline:

3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
│───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───│
↑       ↑       ↑
│       │       └─── Step 3 → 6, next step 12 → 18 ❌ skipped
│       └──────────── Step 3 → 6
└─────────────────── Start
```

**The timeline reveals:**
- ✅ You stay **within bounds**
- ❌ Any attempt to **walk past** start = **error**
- 💤 Attempts to walk beyond the end = **ignored silently**

## Final Thoughts

The **Walking at the Edge** model is a hallmark of **user-centered**, **logic-consistent** design. It avoids unnecessary constraints while preserving logical safety. This balance makes the `stzWalker` not only easy to use, but also a tool that **"walks" like a human would think** — attentive, adaptive, and smartly cautious.

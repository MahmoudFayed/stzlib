# Enhancing Programming with String Art in Ring

In todays programming, creativity and fun are often overlooked in favor of functionality and efficiency. However, the Softanza library for Ring language brings a delightful twist to coding by introducing string art texts and paintings. These visual elements can significantly enhance the programming experience, particularly in areas such as code narrations, educational examples, and console text-based games. Let's explore how this unique feature can make programming more engaging and enjoyable.

## The Power of Visual Appeal

The Softanza library offers a wide array of string art designs, ranging from simple shapes to complex scenes. These include:

1. Collectibles (coins, stars, hearts)
2. Environmental elements (trees, clouds)
3. Game elements (checkpoints, arrows)
4. Transportation (rockets, cars, spaceships)
5. Animals (cats, dogs, teddies)
6. Characters (heroes, wizards, princesses)
7. Buildings (castles)
8. Special effects (explosions, rain, fire)
9. Weapons (swords, bows, wands)
10. Human body parts
11. Miscellaneous designs

By incorporating these visual elements into your code, you can create more engaging console outputs, making your programs not just functional, but visually appealing as well.

## Enhancing Code Narrations

One of the primary uses of string art in programming is to enhance code narrations. Instead of plain text explanations, you can use relevant icons or images to illustrate your points. For example:

```ring
load "stzStringArt.ring"

? "Welcome to our coding adventure!"
? StringArt("#{Rocket}")
? "Let's blast off into the world of Ring programming!"

#-->
# Welcome to our coding adventure!
#      △
#     ╱▲╲
#    ╱╱ ╲╲
#   ╱╱···╲╲
#  ╱╱·····╲╲
# ╱╱┌─────┐╲╲
# │││ ▓▓▓ │││
# │││ ▓▓▓ │││
# ╰╰───────╯╯
#  ╰┌─────┐╯
#   │ ███ │
#   │ ███ │
#   ╰─────╯
# Let's blast off into the world of Ring programming!
```


This simple addition of a rocket ASCII art can make your introduction more memorable and exciting for new programmers.

## Making Educational Examples More Engaging

When teaching programming concepts, visual aids can significantly improve understanding and retention. The string art library can be used to create more engaging educational examples. For instance, when explaining conditional statements:

```ring
load "stzStringArt.ring"

CheckWeather(35)
#-->
# It's hot outside!
#    \   🌞  /
#   \  \│/  /
# ─ ─ ─ ☀ ─ ─ ─
#   /  /│\  \
#     /    \  \

# CheckWeather(25)
#-->
# It's cool today.
#          .-~~~-.
#  .- ~ ~-(       )_ _
# /                     ~ -.
# |                           \
#  \                         .'
#    ~- . _____________ . -~

func CheckWeather(temperature)
    if temperature > 30
        ? "It's hot outside!"
        ? StringArt("#{Sun rise}")
    else
        ? "It's cool today."
        ? StringArt("#{Cloud}")
    ok
```


This example not only explains the concept but also provides a visual representation of the outcome, making it more intuitive for learners.

## Elevating Console Text-Based Games

Perhaps the most exciting application of string art is in console text-based games. These visual elements can transform simple text adventures into more immersive experiences.

First you can use the string arts to propose a beatuful startup screen of your console program, like this one:

```ring
load "stzlib.ring"

# Displaying the game logo

? StringArt("#{tree}")

# Displaying the game title

SetStringArtStyle(:neon)
? StringArt("MIMOSA") + NL

# Showing the button of start

? StzStringQ(" PLAY NOW! ").BoxedRound() + NL

# A secondary text

? " Powered by: Softanza and the Ring GameEngine (c)"

#-->
#    🍃
#    🍃🍃
#   🍃🍃🍃
#  🍃🍃🍃🍃
# 🍃🍃🍃🍃🍃
#     ┃━┃
#     ┃━┃
#  ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
# ╭━╮╭━╮ ╭━━━╮ ╭━╮╭━╮ ╭━━━╮ ╭━━━╮ ╭━━━╮
# ┃┃╰╯┃┃ ┃┃┃┃┃ ┃┃╰╯┃┃ ┃╭━╮┃ ┃╭━━╯ ┃╭━╮┃
# ┃╭╮╭╮┃  ┃┃┃  ┃╭╮╭╮┃ ┃┃ ┃┃ ╰━━╮  ┃┃━┃┃
# ┃┃┃┃┃┃ ┃┃┃┃┃ ┃┃┃┃┃┃ ┃╰━╯┃ ╭━━╯  ┃┃ ┃┃
# ╰╯╰╯╰╯ ╰━━━╯ ╰╯╰╯╰╯ ╰━━━╯ ╰━━━╯ ╰━ ━╯
# 
# ╭─────────────╮
# │  PLAY NOW!  │
# ╰─────────────╯
# 
# Powered by: Softanza and the Ring GameEngine (c)

```


And you can imagine any kind of text-based RPG, like for example:

```ring
load "stzlib.ring"

EncounterMonster()
#-->
# You encounter a fearsome dragon!
#    /\\__/\\
#   (  @@  )
#  /\\  )\(  /\\
# (__\\/  \\/__)
#    | /\\ |
#    \\(__)/
#     `''`
# 
# What will you do?
# 1. Fight
# 2. Run
# Enter your choice: 2
# 
# You turn and run as fast as you can!
# oooO
# ( )
# \ (
# \_)

func EncounterMonster()
    ? "You encounter a fearsome dragon!"
    ? StringArt("#{Dragon}") + NL
    ? "What will you do?"
    ? "1. Fight"
    ? "2. Run"

    ? "Enter your choice: " give choice

    if choice = "1"
        ? "You draw your sword and prepare for battle!"
        ? StringArt("#{Sword}")
    else
        ? "You turn and run as fast as you can!"
        ? StringArt("#{RightFeet}")
    ok
```

This simple encounter becomes much more vivid with the addition of visual representations of the dragon, sword, and running feet.

Technically, the game could be made interative, coulorful and more engaging by leveraging the RingRogueUtil extension, for making console text-based user interfaces, and RingEngine library for more sophisticaded games.

## Using other visual features

Along with string arts, Softanza provides you with other interesting visual features that you can you tp boost your text-based UIs:

- Boxing  strings in stzString to make buttons and other framed dialogs, like in the "PLAY NOW!" button in the "Mimoza" example above 
- Displaying a visual representation of a table of data in stzTable
- Displaying grids and visually managing their nodes


Here is quick example that illustrâtes boxing a string (the same we used in the MIMOZA example above):

```ring
load "stzlib.ring"

? StzStringQ("  PLAY NOW!  ").Boxed() + NL
#-->
# ╭─────────────╮
# │  PLAY NOW!  │
# ╰─────────────╯

```

This one th show the use of a stzGrid, fill it with letters, and display it in a text-based output:

```ring
# Create a grid of 10 by 10 nodes
StzGridQ([ :Of = 10, :By = 10 ]) {

	# Fill the grid with the chars between " " and "z"
	FillWith( CharsBetween(" ", :And = "z") )

	# Show the grid
	Show()
}

#-->
#   ! " # $ % & ' ( ) *
#   + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4
#   5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = >
#   ? @ A B C D E F G H
#   I J K L M N O P Q R
#   S T U V W X Y Z [ \
#   ] ^ _ ` a b c d e f
#   g h i j k l m n o p
```

And this one to see how tabular data hose in a stzTable object can be bautifully displayed on the screen:

```ring
# You create a table with this structure:

o1 = new stzTable([
	[ :COL1,    :COL2,    :COL3 ],
	#----------------------------#
	[ 10,	    100,      1000  ],
	[ 20,	    200,      2000  ],
	[ "*",	    "*",      "*"   ],
	[ 30,	    300,      3000  ]
])

# And you want to show it on screen:

? o1.Show() + NL # There is a more elaborated ShowXT() variation that you can configure at your will

#-->  COL1    COL2   COL3
#    ------ ------- ------
#       10     100    1000
#       20     200    2000
#        *       *       *
#       30     300    3000
```


## Creating Custom Designs

The Softanza library also allows for creating custom string art designs. This feature enables programmers to tailor the visual elements to their specific needs. You just need to add a string global variable containing the design to the stzStringData.ring file, and use its globale name (which must be preceded by the char $) when you call the StringArt() function. For example:s

```ring
load "stzStringArt.ring"

$CustomLogo = "
   ____  _
  / __ \(_)____  ____ _
 / /_/ / / ___/ / __ `/
/ _, _/ / /    / /_/ /
/_/ |_/_/_/     \__,_/
"

? StringArt("#{" + customLogo + "}")
#-->
   ____  _
  / __ \(_)____  ____ _
 / /_/ / / ___/ / __ `/
/ _, _/ / /    / /_/ /
/_/ |_/_/_/     \__,_/

```

This ability to create custom designs opens up endless possibilities for branding your console applications or creating unique game assets.

## Conclusion

The string art feature in the Softanza library for Ring language demonstrates that programming doesn't have to be all about dry code and plain text outputs. By incorporating visual elements, we can make the coding experience more enjoyable, educational content more engaging, and console applications more appealing. Whether you're teaching new programmers, creating text-based games, or simply want to add a touch of creativity to your code, the string art library offers a fun and unique way to enhance your Ring programming projects.

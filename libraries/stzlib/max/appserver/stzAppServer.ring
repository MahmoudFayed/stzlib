# Create a dedicated application server for Softanza
# We need it because using the library as-is in web
# application requires loading it each time a request
# is handled.

# The application server should be able to run any
# Ring app, and contain industrial-grade features,
# like authentifictaion, logging, caching, parrallelization, etc.

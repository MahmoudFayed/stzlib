to Bert Mariani, The Ring Programming Language
Hello Bert,

Thank you for your message!

In a nutshell, the library does the following:

Adds the support of Unicode in string management
Enriches the four native types of Ring with for new types (stzNumber, stzString, stzList, and stzObject)
Adds new types like the char type (in stzChar), list of bytes type (stzListOfBytes), and stzHashList
Provides more data structures to work with like sets (stzSet), trees (stzTree), grids (stzGrid), and tables (stzTable).
For every type, it includes a convenience class for managing a listof that type. For example: stzListOfNumbers, stzListOfStrings, and even stzListOfLists!
Leverages the conversion between types, like for example the conversion between stzHexNumber and stzBinaryNumber and many other
Empowers application developers with advanced features like indexing (used for search), caching (used for performance), and translation (for multilingual apps).
Covers many of the features of RingQt that are lacking to Ring, by simplifying their use, like operations on dates, time, calendars, and many others.
Some of the features of RingQt, like Locales, are made both easier and more accurate, since the standard implementation contains many inconsistencies and sometimes some mistakes.
Along with some innovations (I'm keeping secret until now ;), that are unique in revamping the programming experience for the rest of us.

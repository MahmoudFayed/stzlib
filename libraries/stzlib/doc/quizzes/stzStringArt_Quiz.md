Welcome to the Softanza StringArt Mastery quiz!

This set of multiple-choice questions is designed to help programmers deepen their understanding of the StringArt feature in the Softanza library. By mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to create and manipulate string art representations in your Ring programming projects.

> NOTE: The string art above was generated using the following code:
```ring
load "stzlib.ring"
? StringArt("#{Sparkle}")
? StringArt("QUIZ!")
```

Why not try it yourself? Simply copy and paste it into your Ring editor.

## Learning Goals

1. Understand Softanza's layered architecture and file organization.
2. Master the usage of StringArt functions and the stzStringArt class.
3. Learn to work with different string art styles and custom paintings.
4. Gain proficiency in manipulating and customizing string art representations.
5. Comprehend the relationship between SoftanzaCore and SoftanzaPrime layers.

For educators: This quiz can be used in educational programming settings to assess students' understanding of Softanza's StringArt feature and the underlining files typlology and layered softaware architecture. It covers various aspects from basic usage to more advanced concepts, making it suitable for different skill levels.

## Scoring Barometer

Calculate your score by giving yourself 1 point for each correct answer. Then, use the following barometer to assess your knowledge and determine your next steps:

- 13-15 points: Excellent! You have a strong grasp of Softanza's StringArt feature. Keep exploring advanced topics and consider contributing to the Softanza community.
- 10-12 points: Good job! You have a solid understanding but could benefit from reviewing some specific areas. Focus on the questions you got wrong and practice using those features.
- 7-9 points: You're on the right track, but there's room for improvement. Spend more time working with StringArt in practice and re-read the documentation.
- 4-6 points: You have a basic understanding, but need to deepen your knowledge. Start by thoroughly reading the StringArt documentation and working through basic examples.
- 0-3 points: It seems you're just getting started with Softanza StringArt. Don't worry! Begin by reading the introductory documentation and try creating simple string art representations to build your foundation.

Remember, mastering Softanza StringArt is an iterative process. Don't be discouraged if you didn't score as high as you hoped. Use this quiz as a guide to identify areas for improvement and continue practicing. Happy coding!

# Recursive Named Matching in Softanza: A Comprehensive Guide


Imagine you're a detective investigating a complex message with hidden layers. Some messages are like Russian nesting dolls - each layer reveals another secret beneath. This is precisely what recursive named matching in Softanza helps you unravel.

## A Concrete Example: Nested Parentheses Exploration

Let's dive into a practical demonstration that illuminates the power of recursive named matching:

```ring
// Pattern with nested (recursive) named capture groups
rx = StzRegexQ("(?<outermost>\((?<middle>[^()]*(\((?<innermost>[^()]+)\))?[^()]*)\))")

// String with 3 levels of nested parentheses
cTestStr = "(outer(middle(inner)))"

? @@NL( rx.RecursiveMatchInfoXT(cTestStr) )
#-->
# [
#  [ "type", "recursive" ],
#  [ "depth", 3 ],
#  [ "matches", [
#    [ [ "outermost", "(middle(inner))" ], [ "position", [ 7, 21 ] ] ],
#    [ [ "middle", "middle(inner)" ], [ "position", [ 8, 20 ] ] ],
#    [ [ "innermost", "(inner)" ], [ "position", [ 14, 20 ] ] ]
#  ]]
# ]
```

## Anatomy of the Pattern

Let's dissect our recursive matching pattern:

1. `(?<outermost>...)`: Captures the entire matched structure
   - Identifies the broadest layer of nesting
   - Provides context for the entire matched expression

2. `(?<middle>...)`: Captures the middle layer's content
   - Reveals the intermediate nesting level
   - Allows for flexible content between parentheses

3. `[^()]*`: A crucial flexibility mechanism
   - Permits arbitrary text between parentheses
   - Prevents rigid, overly strict matching

4. `(\((?<innermost>[^()]+)\))?`: Optional nested inner capture
   - Allows for potential inner nesting
   - Optional, so it doesn't break if no inner structure exists

## Matching Logic Explained

When Softanza performs recursive named matching, it:
1. Scans the input text systematically
2. Identifies nested matching structures
3. Extracts named groups at each hierarchical level
4. Preserves the semantic meaning of each captured segment

## Key Insights from Our Example

In the output `"(outer(middle(inner)))"`:
- **Outermost Match**: `"(middle(inner))"` 
  - Captures the entire nested structure
  - Starts at position 7, ends at 21

- **Middle Match**: `"middle(inner)"`
  - Reveals the intermediate layer
  - Starts at position 8, ends at 20

- **Innermost Match**: `"(inner)"`
  - Captures the deepest nested structure
  - Starts at position 14, ends at 20

## Pattern Design Constraints

To achieve successful recursive named matching, your regex pattern must:

1. **Include Named Capture Groups**
   - Use `(?<name>...)` syntax precisely
   - Provide meaningful, unique group names
   - Ensure at least one named group exists

2. **Support Nested Structure**
   - Create potential for nested captures
   - Use flexible matching mechanisms
   - Allow optional intermediate content

3. **Embrace Structural Flexibility**
   - Permit variable content between captures
   - Utilize `?` for optional components
   - Enable partial or incomplete nesting

## Mental Model: The Nested Map Explorer

Think of recursive named matching like exploring a multi-level map:
- Each layer has a unique identifier
- You can dive into nested regions effortlessly
- Not every path must be fully explored
- Flexibility is your greatest discovery tool

## Practical Applications

Recursive named matching excels in scenarios such as:
- Parsing complex nested programming language constructs
- Analyzing hierarchical document structures
- Extracting intricate configuration settings
- Investigating nested mathematical or logical expressions

## Conclusion: Beyond Simple Text Matching

Recursive named matching transcends traditional regex. It's not merely about finding text - it's about understanding the semantic structure hidden within your data.

Softanza's approach provides both flexibility and precision, empowering developers to navigate and extract meaning from the most complex textual landscapes.

# Softanza Magic: Calculating Numbers Inside a Stringâ€”Effortlessly!

In Softanza, you can perform calculations directly on numbers within a string,  and the string updates dynamically with the new values!

```ring
o1 = new stzString("The total is 42 dollars and 13 cents.")
o1 {

	MultiplyByN(2)
	? Content()
	#--> The total is 84 dollars and 26 cents.

	DivideByN(2)
	? Content()
	#--> The total is 42 dollars and 13 cents.

	AddN(8)
	? Content()
	#--> The total is 50 dollars and 21 cents.

	RetrieveN(12)
	? Content() + NL
	#--> The total is 38 dollars and 9 cents.
}
```

Need different calculations for each number?  
Use the e`XT`ended form to apply unique operations to each number in the string!

```ring
o1 = new stzString("The total is 42 dollars and 13 cents.")
o1 {

	MultiplyByNXT([2, 3])  # "42" is multiplied by 2, "13" by 3
	? Content()
	#--> The total is 84 dollars and 39 cents.

	DivideByNXT([2, 3])
	? Content()
	#--> The total is 42 dollars and 13 cents.

	AddNXT([8, 7])
	? Content()
	#--> The total is 50 dollars and 20 cents.

	RetrieveNXT([40, 10])
	? Content()
	#--> The total is 10 dollars and 10 cents.
}

*A multi-generational family joyfully sitting around a bag of vibrant flowers.*

Softanza is an innovative approach to programming that dissolves the complexity of code, offering an inclusive pathway for individuals—regardless of their technical background—to transform their ideas into working software.

## Introduction

Softanza can be defined as:

- An Augmentation Library of the Ring Programming Language
- A Programming Framework for Computational Thinking
- A Systemized Foundation for Modern Software Platforms

To fulfill its mission, the Softanza project builds on the simplicity and flexibility of Ring language to forge a tower of layered innovations (see the diagram further down on this page). Each layer adds an incremental useful dimension to the programmer experience and a concrete value proposition to the final software solution.

## Ring as a Computational Infrastructure of the Softanza Library and Framework

Softanza extends the Ring type system while maintaining its simplicity and well-thought design. It leverages unique Ring innovations like declarative and natural language programming and benefits from the metal force of its C and C++ extensions.

Theerefore, at its simplest form, Softanza is a library for the Ring programming language.

## Softanza as an Augmentation Library of the Ring Programming Language

Softanza elevates Ring's capabilities through a comprehensive library that addresses modern development needs. Its contributions are multi-fold:

- **Filling the Gaps**: It adds the missing pieces necessary for professional, enterprise-grade applications.
- **Addressing Pain Points**: Softanza addresses the majority of usability and performance challenges encountered while developing the library with Ring.
- **Unleashing Potential**: It takes Ring's unique features and innovations, putting them into action in ways that make sense for real-world development.
- **Unified Coherence**: Softanza unifies the semantics of Ring and its extension libraries, shaping them into a coherent and powerful model.
- **Stress Testing**: By providing a real-world, large-scale codebase, it stress-tests Ring, pushing it to its limits and ensuring reliability.

While written in Ring and primarily targeting Ring programmers, Softanza's syntax and semantics are designed to be universal and technology-agnostic. Its high-level abstractions and natural orientation position it as a framework for human-centric computational thinking, capable of scaling seamlessly across programming languages.

Ultimately, Softanza can even be used without requiring any programming language other than natural language! The next section will show you this not just a promise...

> **NOTE**: In particular, a **JavaScript** port of Softanza is currently being developed to provide the same programming experience for web frontends. The SystemLayer of the library (described in Section 4 hereafter) is intended to be partially implemented in **Julia**. A full port is also planned, to align with a larger ecosystem of data-intensive and AI-driven applications.

## Softanza as a Programming Framework for Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is the ability to conceptualize, design, and articulate solutions to complex problems through a programming environment that mirrors natural thought processes. Under the motto "What You Think Is What You Write", Softanza fosters this approach.

Softanza fosters computational thinking without enforcing rigid technical constraints. Simply load the library, and you can write pure Ring code like this:

```ring
load "stzlib.ring"

if Q("SOFTANZA").
	IsAMQ(:String).WhichIsQ().InUppercaseQ().
	WhileQ().ContainingQ( TheLetters([ "F", :And = "Z" ]) ).
	TheLetterQ("A").TwiceQ().
	AndQ().HavingQ().ItsQM().FirstCharQ().EqualTo("S")

	? "It's me, Softanza!"
ok
```

This code illustrates Softanza's **natural-coding** paradigm, where natural expressions are integrated directly into computer code. It utilizes a `stzString` object on the surface, while being empowered internally with advanced classes like `stzChainOfTruth` and `stzChainOfValue`.

It demonstrates how Softanza’s programming model seamlessly integrates logical assertions with value transformations to forge a realistic human-centered flow of thought in pure Ring code!

You can even *talk* to Softanza not in pure Ring but in pure English, as effortlessly and intuitively as this:

```ring
Naturally() {

	Create a stzString object with nothing inside

	Append it with the string "softanza"

	Spacify it Uppercase it and_ Box@ it
	The box@ must be rounded

	Then show the final result

}
#-->
# ╭─────────────────╮
# │ S O F T A N Z A │
# ╰─────────────────╯
```

The code instantiates an `stzNatural` object and leverages Ring's natural language innovations to work with words, interpret their meaning, and bind them seamlessly to internal Softanza classes and functions.

Here’s a snapshot of the code running in my Ring Notepad to show it in action:

On top of this Ring magic, made possible by the genius of Mahmoud Fayed (Ring Creator), Softanza incorporates findings from the Computational Linguistics R&D efforts conducted by its author (me, Mansour Ayouni). These innovations address three key pillars of any thinking process: the **Semantic** Model, the **Mental** Model, and the **Expression** Model. All of these are built on top of its Ring Foundation library, as illustrated in the following diagram.

>NOTE:*The diagram also illustrates all the other layers of the Softanza Project discussed on this page.*

Let's describe briefly each model apart.

- **A Learning and Usability Mental Model** to describe the program wolrd

This is the minimal understanding needed to master thousands of the library's features, formed of well-defined, easy-to-learn steps.

- **A Knwoledg-Based Semantic Model** to understand the code of that world

This refers to the semantics of the world your code addresses, represented through an extensive set of data structures, carefully designed as feature-rich Softanza objects.

- **A Natural-Oriented Expression Model** to Talk to and about your program world in Your Own Words!

This defines how you express your thoughts in code using a fluent-oriented, declarative, or near-natural language design.

But wait—Softanza does all this to ultimately empower innovators to meet the market with transformational digital solutions that truly make a difference!

## Softanza as a Systemized Foundation for Modern Software Platforms

At its core, Softanza is an accelerative foundation for building modern software platforms and bringing them to the market economy. It achieves this through:

- **Systems-Based Approach**: Softanza champions a systems-based methodology to software engineering, enabling rapid prototyping and reducing time-to-delivery.
- **Simplified Architectural Patterns**: Architectural patterns like knowledge-oriented programming and reactive programming are simplified into a smooth, accessible experience.
- **Performance Meets Accessibility**: Built on high-performance C and C++ solutions, Softanza wraps them in an accessible coding model.
- **Global Software Readiness**: It natively supports Unicode, multilingual programming, and locale-specific functionality.
- **Cross-Platform Delivery**: With support for all platforms enabled by Ring, Softanza also provides an API-first delivery model through a dedicated and robust Softanza Application Server.

## Softanza as a Collaborative, Multi-Disciplinary Coding Experience

Softanza's computational thinking perspective empowers a wide range of stakeholders—business analysts, information designers, data analysts, UI and UX designers, educators, and researchers—to contribute meaningfully. Through its "What You Think Is What You Write" approach, Softanza enables each person to express themselves naturally within a shared coding environment.

All they need to do is embrace Softanza's Mental Model and natural coding paradigm and start creating working prototypes for their programs, leaving the final implementation details to the coders at a lower level.

In practice, Business Analysts, UX Designers, Educators, Researchers, and Linguists alike would benefit from this approach: 

- **Business Analysts** will craft executable specifications and build the business-specific domain language (DSL) to define the software's core logic, ensuring alignment with business needs.
  
- **UX Designers** will not just create wireframes; they will design the UI structure and interactions directly in declarative code, enabling them to test and iterate on prototypes seamlessly.

- **Educators** and **Researchers** can embed real, executable programs written in near-natural language into their tutorials and research papers, offering hands-on learning experiences for their audiences.

- **Linguists** can model language structures and processes directly in code, bridging the gap between linguistic theory and practical applications in software. 

## Conclusion

Softanza is more than just a programming framework—it's an invitation to a simpler, more intuitive way of writing code and building software. By embracing computational thinking and fostering collaboration across disciplines, Softanza makes programming accessible, efficient, and aligned with human thought processes.

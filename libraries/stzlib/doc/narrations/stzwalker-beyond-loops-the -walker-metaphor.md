# Beyond Loops: The Walker Metaphor in Softanza

Traditional programming often relies on loops—`for`, `while`, and `foreach`—to traverse sequences. But what if there were a more declarative, fluent, and expressive way to walk through data?

Softanza Library for the Ring programming language introduces exactly that: the **Walker Metaphor**, realized through the `stzWalker` class. This elegant abstraction reimagines iteration by focusing on what you want to traverse, not how to traverse it.

## Understanding the Walker Metaphor

A walker in Softanza represents an entity that can traverse a sequence of positions according to defined parameters. The core idea is to replace imperative loop constructs with a more declarative approach — one that focuses on *what* you want to accomplish rather than *how* to accomplish it.

### Key Concepts

- **Walkable Positions**: Locations the walker can visit.
- **Step Size**: Distance between consecutive positions.
- **Current Position**: The walker’s present location.
- **Walking History**: Record of positions visited.

## Integration with `stzList` and `stzString`

In practice, most Softanza developers rarely use `stzWalker` directly. Instead, they interact with its capabilities through the `stzList` and `stzString` classes, both of which embed walker-based functionality.

This integration allows for powerful, declarative operations on collections:

For `stzList` objects, the embedded walker can:

- Traverse elements in a given pattern (e.g., every other item).
- Apply transformations only to selected elements.
- Generate new lists by walking specific positions.

For `stzString`objects, the walker enables:

- Navigating characters efficiently.
- Operating on ranges of positions (e.g., every vowel or character group).
- Extracting or transforming substrings based on walkable steps.

So while understanding `stzWalker` is key, you’ll typically benefit from it indirectly via higher-level abstractions. For advanced use cases or custom traversal logic, using `stzWalker` directly remains a valuable tool.

## Getting Started with `stzWalker`

The `stzWalker` class can be initialized using three possitional parameters, like this:

```ring
oWalker = new stzWalker(1, 10, 2)
```

These parameters become expressive when they are named like this:

```ring
oWalker = new stzWalker(:Start = 1, :End = 10, :Step = 2)
```

Both initializations create a walker that can traverse positions from 1 to 10 in steps of 2 — that is, it will visit 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.


## Basic Operations

Before diving into advanced workflows, let’s look at the foundational operations a walker can perform. These give you insight into what it sees, where it goes, and how it moves.

### Inspecting Positions

We begin by asking the walker what it knows:

```ring
ringoWalker = new stzWalker(1, 10, 2)

? oWalker.Positions()         # All positions: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
? oWalker.WalkablePositions() # Walkable positions: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
? oWalker.Unwalkables()       # Unwalkable positions: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

This allows for easy inspection and even debugging — making traversal visible.


### Walking Step-by-Step

Now let's take some steps and watch how the walker progresses through its path.

```ring
ringoWalker = new stzWalker(3, 9, 2)

? oWalker.Walk()     # Walks one step: [3, 5]
? oWalker.Position() # Current position: 5

? oWalker.WalkN(2)   # Walks two steps: [5, 7, 9]
? oWalker.Position() # Current position: 9
```

Each movement updates the walker's current position and walking history.


### Directional and Range Walking

The walker isn't limited to forward movement — you can direct it explicitly to positions or ranges.

```ring
ringoWalker = new stzWalker(3, 12, 2)
oWalker.WalkTo(7)           ## Walk to position 7: [3, 5, 7]
oWalker.WalkToFirst()       ## Walk to first position: [7, 5, 3]
oWalker.WalkToLast()        ## Walk to last position: [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
oWalker.WalkBetween(5, 9)   ## Walk between positions: [5, 7, 9]
```

This range-based walking provides fine-grained control without needing conditional loops.


### Walking in a Loop

If you need traditional iteration, `stzWalker` supports loop-based walking too — but with a cleaner API:

```ring
ringoWalker = new stzWalker(1, 10, 2)

while oWalker.HasNext()
    oWalker.Walk()
    ? oWalker.Position()
end
## Outputs: 3, 5, 7, 9
```

This blends seamlessly with Ring’s syntax while avoiding manual tracking.


### Handling Walking History

Walkers remember where they’ve been — and you can access that history:

```ring
w = new stzWalker(3, 10, 2)

w.Walk()                     ## [3, 5]
w.WalkBetween(7, 9)          ## [7, 9]
w.WalkFromLast()             ## [9]

? w.Walks()                   ## [[3, 5], [7, 9], [9]]
? w.FirstWalk()               ## [3, 5]
? w.LastWalk()                ## [9]
```

This is useful for repeatable traversals, undo-like operations, and analysis.


## Advanced Features

As you get more comfortable with walkers, you'll discover more nuanced features designed for flexibility and power. Here's a tour of those capabilities with contextual notes.

### Backward Walking

Sometimes you want to walk from high to low. That’s easy to configure:

```ring
ringoWalker = new stzWalker(12, 1, 2)
? oWalker.Walkables()        ## [12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
```

Simply reverse the start and end values — the walker adjusts accordingly.


### Checking Walkable Status

Want to check if a specific position is walkable?

```ring
ringoWalker = new stzWalker(1, 10, 2)
? oWalker.IsWalkable(3)      ## TRUE
? oWalker.IsWalkable(4)      ## FALSE
```

This lets you enforce or debug logic that depends on reachable positions.


### Remaining Walkables

To see what’s still ahead, ask the walker:

```ring
ringoWalker = new stzWalker(1, 12, 2)
oWalker.WalkN(2)             ## [1, 3, 5]
? oWalker.RemainingWalkables() ## [7, 9, 11]
```

Great for predictive logic or partial walks.

- **Fluent API**: Enables readable, chainable expressions.
- **Direction Flexibility**: Forward, backward, or by jump.
- **Intrinsic Step Control**: Step is a native property.
- **Built-in History**: Access complete traversal records.
- **Position Awareness**: Native to the object.
- **Semantic Clarity**: Code reads like the intent.

## Conclusion

The Walker metaphor in Softanza is more than a clever utility — it’s a shift in how iteration is expressed. Rather than focusing on `how` to loop, you define *where to go* and *how to step*, leading to cleaner, safer, and more expressive code.

Most of the time, you’ll benefit from this metaphor indirectly via `stzList` or `stzString`, but knowing how it works under the hood gives you the flexibility to create custom traversal logic where needed.

Ultimately, this abstraction encourages developers to think in terms of **positions and movement**, rather than indices and counters — resulting in clearer, more robust solutions.

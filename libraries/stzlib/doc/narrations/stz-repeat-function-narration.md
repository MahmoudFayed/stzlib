Softanza introduces a remarkable function `Repeat()`, along with its e**XT**ended form `RepeatXT()`, that transforms **value repetition** into an elegant, flexible coding technique. These methods allow developers to duplicate and transform values **across various data structures** with unprecedented ease and precision.

---

## Basic Repetition

Softanza have a `Repeat()` function you can use like this:

```ring
load "stzlib.ring"

Repeat("A", 3)
#--> [ "A", "A", "A" ]

# Which is the same as:

? RepeatInList("A", 3)
#--> [ "A", "A", "A" ]

# And when you want the repetition to be put in a string:

? RepeatInString("A", 3) # Equivalent of Ring copy() function
#--> "AAA"
```

But this is just a part of the story. Say hello to the extended `RepeatXT()` function!

## List Repetition

Does the fellowing code need any explanation? Well, let's repeat the char "5" in a list of size 2:

```ring
? Q("5").RepeatedXT(:InA = :List, :OfSize = 2)
#--> [ "5", "5" ]

? Q("A").RepeatedInAPair()
#--> [ "A", "A" ]
```

Both are equivalent, but the second is more concise and expressive.

## Numeric and Type Conversion

Repetition can happen along with smart type conversion. Which is as mutch useful as poweful:

```ring
@@( Q("5").RepeatedXT(:InA = :ListOfNumbers, :OfSize = 3) )
#--> [ 5, 5, 5 ]

Q("5").RepeatedXT(:InA = :String, :OfSize = 3)
#--> "555"

Q(5).RepeatedXT(:InA = :String, :OfSize = 3)
#--> "555"
```
The RepeatXT() function effortlessly converts inputs between strings, numbers, and collections, preserving their essence while fulfilling the repetition requirements.

## Mixed Type Repetition

Real-world programming often requires working with multiple data types and nested structures. The `RepeatedXT()` method rises to this challenge with remarkable flexibility:

```ring
@@( Q(5).RepeatedXT(:InA = :ListOfStrings, :OfSize = 3) )
#--> [ "5", "5", "5" ]

@@( Q("A").RepeatedXT(:InA = :ListOfPairs, :OfSize = 3) ) + NL
#--> [ [ "A", "A" ], [ "A", "A" ], [ "A", "A" ] ]

@@( Q("A").RepeatedXT(:InA = :ListOfLists, :OfSize = 3) ) + NL
#--> [ [ "A" ], [ "A" ], [ "A" ] ]
```
The method's versatility shines in handling complex type transformations. It effortlessly creates lists of strings, pairs, and nested lists, adapting to the developer's needs.

## Advanced Repetition

Sometimes, simple repetition isn't enough. Developers need more complex, nested structures that can be created with minimal code.

```ring
@@( Q("A").
RepeatXTQ(:InA = :List, :OfSize = 3).
RepeatedXT(:InA = :List, :OfSize = 3)
) + NL
#--> [ [ "A", "A", "A" ], [ "A", "A", "A" ], [ "A", "A", "A" ] ]
```
Method chaining introduces a new dimension of usability. By combining `RepeatXTQ()` and `RepeatedXT()`, developers can create intricate nested structures with a single, readable code sequence.

>**NOTE**: Method chaining in Softanza allows fluent design of transformation pipelines by just suffixing the method you wand to chain on with a small `Q()`, like this: `Q("h e l l o").RemoveSpacesQ().UppercaseQ().Content()`, so you get the string `"HELLO"`.

## Multidimensional Structures

Grids, tables, and complex data structures require powerful repetition mechanisms. Softanza provides an elegant solution for generating these sophisticated data representations.

```ring
@@( Q("A").RepeatedXT(:InA = :Grid, :OfSize = [3, 3]) )
#-->
# [
# [ "A", "A", "A" ],
# [ "A", "A", "A" ],
# [ "A", "A", "A" ]
# ]

? @@( Q("A").RepeatedXT(:InA = :Table, :OfSize = [3, 3]) )
#--> [
# [ "COL1", [ "A", "A", "A" ] ],
# [ "COL2", [ "A", "A", "A" ] ],
# [ "COL3", [ "A", "A", "A" ] ]
# ]
```
Hence, the pinnacle of the method's capability lies in generating multidimensional structures. With a single method call, you can create complex grids and tables, populated with repeated elements across different dimensions.

>`@@(val)` is a Softanza small function, akin to a **pair of glasses** that enhance vision, designed to produce a readable string representation of any value `val`.

## Practical Applications

The power of `RepeatXT()` extends far beyond simple code examples, offering tangible benefits in real-world software Development:
1. Rapid data initialization
2. Generating test and placeholder data
3. Performing type-safe conversions
4. Creating complex data structures efficiently
5. Reducing boilerplate code

## Conclusion

Softanza's repetition feature transcends traditional data manipulation approaches. It offers a concise, powerful, and intuitive way to generate, transform, and replicate values across diverse data types and structures.

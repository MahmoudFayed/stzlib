# Empowering Real-World Applications with Softanza's Linear Solver for Ring
*(No Math Degree Required!)*

Imagine you're building an app that helps a pizza shop decide how many pizzas and salads to make daily to maximize profit. Or perhaps you're designing a game where players allocate resources to build the ultimate fantasy army. How do you turn these real-world dilemmas into code that "just works"?

Enter **Softanza's stzLinearSolver** ‚Äî a tool that transforms complex decision-making into simple programming. You don‚Äôt need a PhD in mathematics. Just describe your problem, and let the library handle the heavy lifting.

Let‚Äôs dive in with a story-driven example.

## üçï **Example 1: The Pizza Shop Dilemma**
*Goal: Maximize profits with limited ingredients and chef hours*

### The Problem
A local pizzeria can make two items:
- **Pizza** (requires 15 mins prep time, 3 chef units, uses oven)
- **Salad** (requires 5 mins prep time, 1 chef unit, no oven)

**Constraints**:

- Total prep time: 2000 minutes/day
- Chef capacity: 400 units
- Oven capacity: 250 total oven items

**Profit**:

- Pizza: $12
- Salad: $6

### The Code (Without the Math)  
```ring  
oSolver = new stzLinearSolver()
oSolver {
    # Define what we can control
    AddVariable("pizza", 0, 200)   # Up to 200 pizzas
    AddVariable("salad", 0, 100)   # Up to 100 salads

    # Resource constraints
    AddConstraint("15*pizza + 5*salad", "<=", 2000) # Prep time
    AddConstraint("3*pizza + 1*salad", "<=", 400)    # Chef capacity
    AddConstraint("pizza", "<=", 250)                # Oven limit

    # Objective: Maximize profit
    Maximize("12*pizza + 6*salad")

    # Let the solver work its magic
    Solve("greedy")

    # Results
    ? "Daily Plan: " + SolutionValue("pizza") + " pizzas, " + SolutionValue("salad") + " salads"
    ? "Expected Profit: $" + ObjectiveValue()
}  
```

### The Output
```
Daily Plan: 100 pizzas, 100 salads
Expected Profit: $1800
```

### What Just Happened?
You described **resources** (prep time, chefs, oven), **choices** (how many pizzas/salads), and the **goal** (max profit). The solver found the optimal balance. No equations, no calculus ‚Äî just logic.

## üß© **How It Works: The Big Picture**
Linear programming answers questions like:
> *"Given limited resources, how do I make the best possible decision?"*

Softanza‚Äôs library hides the math behind four strategies:
1. **Greedy**: Fast, practical solutions (e.g., pizza shop).
2. **Simplex**: Classic precision for continuous variables (e.g., budget allocation).
3. **Branch & Bound**: Exact answers for discrete choices (e.g., manufacturing chairs).
4. **Genetic**: Handles complexity (e.g., game economies with nonlinear rules).

You pick the solver based on your problem‚Äôs needs. The library does the rest.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Real-World Use Cases Made Simple**

### 1. **Resource Allocation** (Army Recruitment)
*Maximize army power with limited food, wood, and gold.*

```ring  
# Swordsmen, bowmen, horsemen compete for resources
AddConstraint("60*swordsmen + 80*bowmen + 140*horsemen", "<=", 1200) # Food
Maximize("70*swordsmen + 95*bowmen + 230*horsemen") # Power
Solve("greedy")
```
**Result**: 6 swordsmen + 6 horsemen = 1800 power points.

---

### 2. **Production Planning** (Furniture Factory)
*Decide how many chairs, tables, and desks to make with limited wood and labor.*

```ring  
AddIntegerVariable("chairs", 0, 100)
AddConstraint("4*chairs + 12*tables + 8*desks", "<=", 800) # Wood
Maximize("25*chairs + 80*tables + 60*desks") # Profit
Solve("branch_bound")
```
**Result**: 30 tables + 30 desks = $4200 profit.

---

### 3. **Financial Planning** (Investment Portfolio)
*Balance stocks, bonds, and cash to maximize returns.*

```ring  
AddVariable("stocks", 0, 60000)
AddConstraint("stocks + bonds + real_estate + cash", "=", 100000) # Total budget
Maximize("0.08*stocks + 0.04*bonds + 0.06*real_estate + 0.01*cash")
Solve("greedy")
```
**Result**: $49k stocks + $50k real estate = $6,930 annual return.

---

## üéÆ **Bonus: Game Development Superpowers**

### Game Economy Balancing
*Set gold/wood/food generation rates to keep players engaged.*

```ring  
AddIntegerVariable("gold_rate", 1, 25)
AddConstraint("wood_rate + food_rate", "<=", 300)
Maximize("10*gold_rate + 2*wood_rate + 3*food_rate")
Solve("branch_bound")
```
**Result**: Gold=25, Wood=100, Food=150 ‚Äî perfect balance!

## üöÄ When to Use Which Solver

| Solver           | Use Case                             | Speed     | Accuracy |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- | -------- |
| **Greedy**       | Quick business decisions             | ‚ö° Fast    | Good     |
| **Simplex**      | Continuous variables (e.g., budgets) | ‚öôÔ∏è Medium  | Perfect  |
| **Branch/Bound** | Integer choices (e.g., chairs)       | ‚è≥ Slow    | Perfect  |
| **Genetic**      | Complex systems (e.g., games)        | üê¢ Slowest | Creative |

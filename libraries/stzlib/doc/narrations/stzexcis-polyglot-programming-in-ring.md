## Getting Started with EXCIS

From a programmer's perspective, EXCIS provides three essential capabilities:

1. **Feeding Ring Data to External Code**: Functions like `@@R()`, `@@C()`, and `@@Plg()` serialize Ring data into formats compatible with each language.
2. **Firing External Language Runtimes**: EXCIS launches the necessary runtime environments and executes the provided code.
3. **Retrieving Results in Ring**: Outputs are automatically captured and converted back into Ring data types.

Behind the scenes, more technical work is handled automatically, as shown in the following diagram workflow:


![Softanza EXCIS technical workflow](../images/stz-excis-system.png)

All of this is proposed in a streamlined, very easy‑to‑use programming experience. Let's see it in action!

## Practical Example: Student Analysis Pipeline

Let’s explore EXCIS in action with a student analysis pipeline, showcasing how it chains languages for a multi-step task.

### Part 1: Statistical Analysis in R
Calculate average grades using R’s statistical prowess.

```ring
# Student grade data
students = [["Alice", [85, 90, 78]], ["Bob", [72, 65, 70]]]

# R calculates averages
R = XR()
R.SetCode('
    students <- ' + @@R(students) + '
    results <- list()
    for (i in 1:length(students)) {
        student_name <- students[[i]][1]
        grades <- students[[i]][[2]]
        results[[i]] <- list(name = student_name, mean = mean(grades))
    }
    res <- results
')
R.Run()
stats = R.Result()
# Output: [["Alice", 84.33], ["Bob", 69]]
```

> **Note** : As mentioned before, the `@@R(students)` function is actually used here to transfor the Ring `student`variable to a computable form by R language.

### Part 2: Efficient Sorting in C
Sort students by average using C’s performance edge (imagine thousands of students for real-world scale).

```ring
C = XC()
C.SetCode('
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    typedef struct {
        char name[20];
        double average;
    } Student;
    int main() {
        Student students[2];
        strcpy(students[0].name, "' + @@C(stats[1][1]) + '");
        students[0].average = ' + @@C(stats[1][2]) + ';
        strcpy(students[1].name, "' + @@C(stats[2][1]) + '");
        students[1].average = ' + @@C(stats[2][2]) + ';
        printf("[\"%s\", %.2f], [\"%s\", %.2f]",
            students[0].average > students[1].average ? students[0].name : students[1].name,
            students[0].average > students[1].average ? students[0].average : students[1].average,
            students[0].average > students[1].average ? students[1].name : students[0].name,
            students[0].average > students[1].average ? students[1].average : students[0].average);
        return 0;
    }
')
C.Execute()
ranked = C.Result()
# Output: [["Alice", 84.33], ["Bob", 69]]
```

### Part 3: Rule-Based Classification in Prolog
Classify students using Prolog’s logical reasoning.

```ring
Prolog = XPlg()
Prolog.SetCode('
    classification(Average, "Excellent") :- Average >= 80.
    classification(Average, "Average") :- Average >= 70, Average < 80.
    classification(Average, "Needs Improvement") :- Average < 70.
    analyze_students(Result) :-
        Student1 = ["' + @@Plg(stats[1][1]) + '", ' + @@Plg(stats[1][2]) + '],
        Student2 = ["' + @@Plg(stats[2][1]) + '", ' + @@Plg(stats[2][2]) + '],
        classification(Student1[2], Grade1),
        classification(Student2[2], Grade2),
        Result = [[Student1[1], Grade1], [Student2[1], Grade2]].
')
Prolog.Run()
analysis = Prolog.Result()
# Output: [["Alice", "Excellent"], ["Bob", "Needs Improvement"]]
```

This pipeline demonstrates EXCIS’s ability to chain specialized languages seamlessly, with Ring as the glue.

## Revolutionizing Development with XAI Integration

The **XAI** component elevates EXCIS by integrating large language models (LLMs) as first-class runtimes, enabling natural language queries and reasoning within Ring.

```ring
AI = XAI()
AI.Query("List the top 5 African countries by population in 2024")
countries = AI.Result()
? @@(countries)
# Output: [["Nigeria", 227000000], ["Ethiopia", 126000000], ["Egypt", 112000000], ["DR Congo", 102000000], ["Tanzania", 67000000]]

AI.Query("Analyze these population figures and suggest infrastructure priorities")
analysis = AI.Result()
? analysis
# Output: "Nigeria and Ethiopia should prioritize urban infrastructure due to their large populations. DR Congo’s vast area suggests transportation needs. Egypt’s desert geography calls for water management."
```

XAI adds:
- **Natural Language Data Acquisition**: Generate data without APIs.
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Process outputs from other languages.
- **Domain-Specific Insights**: Tailor reasoning to specific fields.
- **Automated Documentation**: Create code explanations.

An other revounary way of using XAI is to let LLMs and other AI systems generate the external language code for us from natural langauge constructs! Welcome to the upcoming stzPolyCode class…

### Polyglot Innovation with `stzPolyCode`

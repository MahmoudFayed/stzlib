# The Narrative of Transformations: Tracking Object Evolution in Softanza

## Unveiling the Story Behind Data Mutations

In programming, data transformations often happen in the blink of an eye, leaving no trace of their journey. Softanza challenges this paradigm with a groundbreaking feature that captures the entire lifecycle of object modifications.

### The Initial Approach: Transformation Without Memory

Consider this basic string transformation chain in Softanza:

```ring
load "stzlib.ring"

? Q("1 AA 2 B 3 CCC 4 DD 5 Z").
    RemoveWXTQ('{ Q(@Char).IsNumberInString() }').
    RemoveSpacesQ().
    RemoveDuplicatedCharsQ().
    Content() + NL
#--> ABCDZ
```

Here, we process the string, removing numbers, spaces, and duplicate characters. The result is clear, but the path is forgotten.

### The Challenge: Preserving the Transformation Trail

What if we could capture each step of this transformation? Imagine a programming feature that doesn't just give you the final result, but tells you the entire story of how that result was achieved.

### The Solution: Introducing QH() small function

```ring
? @@NL( QH("1 AA 2 B 3 CCC 4 DD 5 Z").
    RemoveWXTQ('{ Q(@Char).IsNumberInString() }').
    RemoveSpacesQ().
    RemoveDuplicatedCharsQ().
    History() ) + NL
#--> [
#	"1 AA 2 B 3 CCC 4 DD 5 Z",      # Original
#	" AA  B  CCC  DD  Z",           # After removing numbers
#	"AABCCCDDZ",                    # After removing spaces
#	"ABCDZ"                         # Final result
# ]
```

### Key Benefits

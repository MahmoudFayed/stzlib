## State Management in Pattern Processing

The `stzRegexuter` implements pattern matching with state tracking, which is useful for various debugging and analytics scenarios, particularly in sensitive data handling and process verification. Consider this example:

```ring
rxu() {
    # Define sensitive data pattern processor
    Trigger(:SensitiveData = "(password|secret|key):\s*(\w+)")
    
    # Define transformation with logging
    @C(:When = :SensitiveData, :Do = '{
        originalLength = len(@value)
        @value = "REDACTED-" + originalLength
    }')

    # Process sensitive content
    Process("User credentials: password: abc123 secret: def456")
    
    ? @@NL(State())
    #--> [
    #    [ "sensitivedata", [ "password: abc123", "REDACTED-16" ] ],
    #    [ "sensitivedata", [ "secret: def456", "REDACTED-14" ] ]
    #    ]
}
```

This state tracking approach demonstrates redaction - a security practice where sensitive information is deliberately obscured while maintaining useful metadata. The "-16" and "-14" suffixes indicate original string lengths, enabling data structure preservation and validation without exposing sensitive content. 

State information serves multiple purposes:
- Development: Pattern matching verification and debugging
- Testing: Validation of redaction completeness
- Auditing: Documentation of sensitive data handling
- Quality Assurance: Verification of transformation accuracy

In production environments, state data should be used temporarily and cleared after validation to maintain security. This balance between functionality and security makes the stzRegexuter particularly suitable for sensitive data processing applications.

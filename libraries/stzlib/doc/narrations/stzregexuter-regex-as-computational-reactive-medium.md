# Softanza Regexuter: Regex as Computational Reactive Medium

The stzRegexuter extends traditional pattern matching into a sophisticated system for reactive computational processing. It transforms conventional regex operations into a dynamic, context-aware framework that enables immediate data transformation and state management.

## The Foundation of Reactive Pattern Computation

The stzRegexuter implements a system where pattern matching directly triggers computational transformations. This approach enables immediate processing of matched patterns within their discovery context:

```ring
load "stzlib.ring"

rxu = new stzRegexuter()
rxu {
    # Define the pattern trigger
    AddTrigger(:NumberFound = "(\d+)")

    # Specify the computational transformation
    AddComputation(
        :When = :NumberFound,
        :Do = '{
            @value = @number(@value) * 2
        }'
    )

    result = Process("Found 42 items")
    ? @@(result)  
    #--> [
    #      [ "matches", [ "42" ] ],
    #      [ "results", [ 84 ] ]
    #    ]
}
```

In this example, numeric patterns are automatically processed and transformed according to specified rules.

## Coordinated Multi-Pattern Processing

The stzRegexuter excels at managing multiple concurrent pattern operations, each with its own transformation logic:

```ring
# We can use directly rxu() as a shorthand for creating a stzRegexuter instance:

rxu() {
    # Define multiple pattern triggers
    Trigger(:Price = "\$(\d+\.?\d*)")
    Trigger(:Date = "(\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4})")
    Trigger(:Email = "([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})")

    # Specify transformations for each pattern
    @C(:When = :Price, :Do = '{ @value = @number(@value) * 1.1 }')  # Tax calculation
    @C(:When = :Date, :Do = '{ @value = StandardizeDate(@value) }')  # Date normalization
    @C(:When = :Email, :Do = '{ @value = "CONTACT: " + @value }')    # Contact annotation

    text = "Order placed on 12/25/2023 for $99.99 by user@example.com"
    result = Process(text)
    ? @@(result)
    #--> [
    #      [ "matches", [ "$99.99", "12/25/2023", "user@example.com" ] ],
    #      [ "results", [ 109.89, "2023-12-25", "CONTACT: user@example.com" ] ]
    #    ]
}
```

This demonstrates simultaneous processing of prices, dates, and contact information within a single execution context.

## State Management in Pattern Processing

The `stzRegexuter` implements pattern matching with state tracking, which is useful for various debugging and analytics scenarios, particularly in sensitive data handling and process verification. Consider this example:

```ring
rxu() {
    # Define sensitive data pattern processor
    Trigger(:SensitiveData = "(password|secret|key):\s*(\w+)")
    
    # Define transformation with logging
    @C(:When = :SensitiveData, :Do = '{
        originalLength = len(@value)
        @value = "REDACTED-" + originalLength
    }')

    # Process sensitive content
    Process("User credentials: password: abc123 secret: def456")
    
    ? @@NL(State())
    #--> [
    #    [ "sensitivedata", [ "password: abc123", "REDACTED-16" ] ],
    #    [ "sensitivedata", [ "secret: def456", "REDACTED-14" ] ]
    #    ]
}
```

This state tracking approach demonstrates redaction - a security practice where sensitive information is deliberately obscured while maintaining useful metadata. The "-16" and "-14" suffixes indicate original string lengths, enabling data structure preservation and validation without exposing sensitive content. 

State information serves multiple purposes:
- Development: Pattern matching verification and debugging
- Testing: Validation of redaction completeness
- Auditing: Documentation of sensitive data handling
- Quality Assurance: Verification of transformation accuracy

In production environments, state data should be used temporarily and cleared after validation to maintain security. This balance between functionality and security makes the stzRegexuter particularly suitable for sensitive data processing applications.

## Advanced Features and Extensions

The stzRegexuter ecosystem includes several specialized components for advanced pattern processing:

### Pattern Analysis with stzRegexAnalyser

The stzRegexAnalyser provides metrics and optimization suggestions for pattern matching operations:

```ring
rxAnalyser = new stzRegexAnalyser()
rxAnalyser {
    EnableMetrics(:For = "(\d+)")
    
    Process("Large dataset: 42, 123, 789, 1024")
    
    ? @@(PatternStats())
    #--> {
    #      matches: 4,
    #      complexity: 0.3,
    #      avgMatchTime: 0.002,
    #      recommendedOptimization: "Combine numeric patterns"
    #    }
}
```

This component helps developers optimize pattern matching performance through detailed analytics.

### Pattern Evolution with stzGeneticRegexuter

The stzGeneticRegexuter implements evolutionary algorithms to optimize pattern matching efficiency:

```ring
rxGenetic = new stzGeneticRegexuter()
rxGenetic {
    DefinePatternPopulation([
        "(\d+)",
        "(\d{1,3})",
        "([0-9]+)"
    ])

    result = EvolvePatterns(
        generations: 10, 
        criteria: { matchCoverage * 0.6 + processingEfficiency * 0.4 }
    )
    
    ? @@(result)
    #--> {
    #      bestPattern: "(\d{1,3})",
    #      fitnessScore: 0.85,
    #      evolutionPath: [ ... ]
    #    }
}
```

This extension automatically improves pattern matching performance through iterative optimization.

### Semantic Processing with stzLinguisticRegexuter

The stzLinguisticRegexuter adds natural language processing capabilities to pattern matching:

```ring

rxLing {
    AddLinguisticPattern(:SubjectAction = "(\w+)\s+(is|was|will)\s+(\w+)")
    
    @C(:When = :SubjectAction, :Do = '{
        AnalyzeSentenceSemantics(@value)
    }')

    result = Process("John will become a leader")
    ? @@(result)
    #--> {
    #      semanticStructure: {
    #        subject: "John",
    #        action: "will become",
    #        object: "leader",
    #        tense: "future"
    #      }
    #    }
}
```

This component enables sophisticated natural language analysis through pattern matching.
